## Continue keyword

The `continue` keyword is used to skip the rest of the code inside the loop for 
the current iteration only and proceed right to the next one. The loop returns to the `for` or 
`while` statement and evaluates the condition again. If there is no next item, 
the `else` clause is executed if it is present.
