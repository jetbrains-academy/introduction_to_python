## while loop

A `while` loop is somewhat similar to an `if` statement: it executes some code if some 
condition is `True`. The key difference is that it will continue to execute indented 
code for as long as the condition is `True`.  If the expression is `False`, the loop terminates.
  
Print all squares from `1` to `99`  `(1, 4, ... , 81)`. Use the `number` variable in a
`while` loop.  

<div class='hint'>Make sure that <code>number</code> is strictly less than 10 in the condition.</div>
