## for loop

The `for` statement is used to iterate over the elements of a sequence (such as 
a string, tuple, or list) or another iterable object. The sequence is evaluated once.
On each iteration, the variable defined in the `for` loop will be assigned to the next value
in the list. The code following the line with the `for` statement is executed once 
for each item. When the items are exhausted, the loop terminates.

You can read more about the `for` statement on <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#the-for-statement">this page</a> of Python Documentation.
  
Print each prime number from the `primes` list using the `for` loop. A prime 
number is a natural number greater than `1` that has no positive divisors 
other than `1` and itself.
