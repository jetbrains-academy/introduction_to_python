## Break keyword

An infinite loop is a loop that never exits. If the loop condition happens to 
always be `True`, such a loop becomes infinite. The most straightforward way to create
an infinite loop is to use `while True`. The `break` keyword is used to 
escape the loop.

### Task
Write a condition to exit the loop on its third iteration after evaluating if `animal`
is equal to `elephant`.  Use the `break` statement.  The `zoo` list in the end should contain 
only `lion` and `tiger` (because you `pop` all the other ones in the loop).

<div class="hint">Use <code>==</code> to check if <code>animal</code> is equal to <code>"elephant"</code>.</div>
