## Boolean operators order

Boolean operators are not evaluated from left to right. There's an order of operations for 
boolean operators: `not` is evaluated first, `and` is evaluated next, and `or` is evaluated last.  

Write an expression that evaluates to `True` if `name` is either `"John"` or `"Jane"` who are `16` or older, but younger than `25`.

Please do not add any extra lines to the code.
