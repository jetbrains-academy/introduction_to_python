## Boolean operators

Boolean operators compare statements and return results in boolean values. The boolean 
operator `and` returns `True` when the expressions on both sides of `and` are `True`.
The boolean operator `or` returns `True` when at least one expression on either side 
of `or` is `True`. The boolean operator `not` inverts the boolean expression it precedes.
