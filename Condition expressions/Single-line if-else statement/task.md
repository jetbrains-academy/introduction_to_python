As you saw in the previous tasks, a simple `if-else` statement can in fact be written as a single line.

### Task
Rewrite the statement in the code editor so that it
fits in one line but the results of its execution remain exactly the same:
- If `my_random_number` is greater than 50, program should print `my_random_number` itself.
- Otherwise, print message `"Too small!"`.
