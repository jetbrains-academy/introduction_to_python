## Class and Instance Variables 2

### Task 

In the class `City`, add a mutable class variable - a list called `all_cities` - to store
all added city names.

Implement the method `add_city` that will append a city name to the `all_cities` list. Do not forget to delete the `pass` statement!

In the `__init__` method, call the `add_city` method to add the city name to the list upon object initialization.
