## String negative indexing

As we said, you can use negative indices to count characters ‘backwards’ starting
from the end of a string.  

For more structured and detailed information, you can refer to [this Hyperskill knowledge base page](https://hyperskill.org/learn/step/6189?utm_source=jba&utm_medium=jba_courses_links).

### Task
Use a negative index to get the `'!'` sign from `long_string`.   

<div class='hint'>Use a negative index.</div>
