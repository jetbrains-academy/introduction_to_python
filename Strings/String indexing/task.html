You can access a character of a string if you know its position.
For example, <code>str[index]</code> will yield the character at
position <code>index</code> in the string <code>str</code>.
<br/>
Note that string index always starts at <code>0</code>.
<br>
Indices may also be negative numbers, to start counting from the right. Note that since <code>-0</code> is the same as <code>0</code>, negative indices start from <code>-1</code>.


<br><br>
Use index operator to get <code>"P"</code> from <code>"python"</code>.
<br>

<div class='hint'>Note that index starts with 0.</div>
