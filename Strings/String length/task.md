## String length

The `len()` method is used to count how many characters a string contains.  
  
Get the first half of the string stored in the variable `phrase`.  
Note: Remember about type conversion.  

<div class='hint'>You need to obtain a slice of the string from its start  
to the middle point.</div>

<div class='hint'>Get the middle index by dividing the string length by 2. The 
division result needs to be an integer.</div>
