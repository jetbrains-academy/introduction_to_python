## Basic string methods

There are many useful string methods. For instance, you can use the `lower()` method to get 
rid of any capitalization in your strings. The `upper()` method is used to make a string 
uppercase. To call any string method, type a dot after the string (or a variable containing 
the string) and the method name after it, e.g., `"John".upper()`. In PyCharm, you can 
explore all available string methods by using the &shortcut:CodeCompletion; shortcut after the dot. 
Detailed information about all string methods can be found <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods">here</a>.
