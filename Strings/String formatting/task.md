## String formatting

The `%` operator after a string is used to combine the string with variables. 
The `%` operator will replace `%s` in a string with the string variable that 
comes after it. The `%d` special symbol is used as a placeholder for numeric 
or decimal values.  

> <i><b>Note</b>: The formatting operations described here exhibit a variety 
> of quirks that lead to a number of common errors. 
> Using the newer formatted string literals (see [further](course://Strings/F-strings)), 
> the <code><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.format">str.format()</a></code> 
> interface, or <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#template-strings">template strings</a> may help avoid these errors. 
> Each of these alternatives provides their own trade-offs and benefits of 
> simplicity, flexibility, and/or extensibility.</i>
