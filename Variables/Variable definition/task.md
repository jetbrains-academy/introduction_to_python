## Variable definition

Variables are used to store values so we can refer to them later. A variable 
is like a label, and in Python we use the ' `=` ' symbol, known as the 
assignment operator, to assign a value to a variable. An assignment can be 
chained, e.g., `a = b = 2`.

### Task
 1. Assign the `World` string to the `name` variable.
 2. On line 10, replace the value in the `name` variable with your actual name.
 3. Use chain assignment to store the value 2 in both `a` and `b` on line 15.
