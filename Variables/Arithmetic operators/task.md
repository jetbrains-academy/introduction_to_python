## Arithmetic operators
In Python to assign a variable you need to use a `=` operator.
```python
x = 1
```

Just as in any other programming language, in Python the addition ( `+` ), 
multiplication ( `*` ), and division ( `/` ) operators can be used with numbers. 

- The `+` (addition) operator yields the sum of its arguments.
  ```python
  x = 1 + 2 # x is 3 now
  ```
- The `*` (multiplication) operator yields the product of its arguments. 
  ```python
  y = 3 * 5 # y is 15 now
  ```
  
- The `/` (division) operator yields the quotient of its arguments. 
  ```python
  z = y / x # z is 5 now
  ```

<div class='hint' title="Where is subtraction?">The other arithmetic operators are covered in the full version of the course.</div>

### Task
 - Divide the value stored in `number` by `2`.
 - Multiply the value stored in `number` by `2`.
 - Add the division result to the multiplication result.

<div class='hint'>First, use the <code>/</code> operator.</div>

<div class='hint'>Then use the <code>*</code> operator.</div>

<div class='hint'>Then use the <code>+</code> operator.</div>
