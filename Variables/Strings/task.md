## Printing a String
Variables are used to store values so we can refer to them later. A variable
is like a label, and in Python we use the ' `=` ' symbol, known as the
assignment operator, to assign a value to a variable.
```python
word = "Anything that comes to mind"
```
Strings in python are surrounded by either single quotation marks, or double quotation marks.
The strings below are the same:
```python
 'hello'
```
```python
 "hello"
 ```

### Task
Assign your name to the variable ```name```.
