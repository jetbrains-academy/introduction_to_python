## Assignments

An augmented assignment is a single statement combining a binary operation and an 
assignment statement, such as `+=`, `-=`, etc.  

An augmented assignment expression like `x += 1` can be rewritten as `x = x + 1` to achieve a similar effect.
You can read more about this <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#augmented-assignment-statements">here</a>.
  
Use an augmented assignment to add `5` to `number` and update the variable.
