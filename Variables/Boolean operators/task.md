## Boolean operators

Boolean is a type of value that can only be `True` or `False`. The `==` (equality) operator 
compares two variables and checks whether they are equal. Use `!=` (not equal) to check that two values differ.

**Examples:**
```python
2 == 2  # 2 equals 2 → True
5 != 6  # 5 is not equal to 6 → True

2 == 4  # 2 does not equal 4 → False
5 != 5  # 5 equals 5 → False
```

You will learn more about boolean operators in a later [task](course://Condition expressions/Boolean operators).

### Task
In this task, insert only these tokens where needed: `==`, `!=`, `True`, `False`.  
The `is` operator checks if two objects are the same – for example, whether a variable is identical to `True` or `False`.
 - Check whether the variable `two` is equal to `three`. This will create a Boolean result stored in `is_equal`.
 - Check if the variable `is_equal` has a deceiving name.
 - Check if the variable `is_false` does indeed contain a lie.
