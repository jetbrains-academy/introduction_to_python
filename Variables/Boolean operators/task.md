## Boolean operators

Boolean is a type of value that can only be `True` or `False`. The `==` (equality) operator 
compares two variables and checks whether they are equal. You will learn more about boolean operators in a later [task](course://Condition expressions/Boolean operators). 

For more structured and detailed information, you can refer to [this Hyperskill knowledge base page](https://hyperskill.org/learn/step/6025?utm_source=jba&utm_medium=jba_courses_links).

### Task
 - Check whether the variable `two` is equal to `three`.
 - Check if the variable `is_equal` has a deceiving name.
 - Check if the variable `is_false` does indeed contain a lie.
