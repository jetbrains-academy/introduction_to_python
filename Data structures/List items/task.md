## List items

Assignment is possible to slices of lists, just like to individual list elements. 
This way you can even change the size of a list or clear it entirely by doing something like:

```python
animals[:] = []
```
  
Make all `animals` elephants by replacing the last two items.  

Please do not add or remove any lines from the code.

<div class='hint'>Use assignment to a slice as in examples.</div>
